                                                                    PART - A 
    Implement the following in Modular Arithmetic: 
    1. Additive inverse of a number 
    2. Multiplicative inverse of a number 
    3. Inverse of an m×m matrix with m ≤ 3 
    4. Implement Diffie Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) Protocol, with small integer values for testing. Hence deliver a man-in-the-middle attack on the DHKE Protocol.

    1. Implement the Euclidean Algorithm, to find GCD of two numbers. 

    2. Given two integers a and b, compute GCD (a,b) as well as b^-1 mod a,  when a and b are co-prime to each other using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
       Implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Hence prove 28-1 mod 75 = 67
