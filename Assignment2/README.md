    1. Implement the following traditional symmetric ciphers. 
      a. Shift Cipher 
      b. Multiplicative Cipher 
      c. Affine Cipher 
      d. Playfair Cipher 
      e. Hill Cipher 
    2. Write programs to carry out exhaustive key search attacks on the Shift Cipher, Multiplicative  Cipher and Affine Cipher that you have implemented. (Aim to attack a cipher is to break its key.) 
      a. Hence use an exhaustive key search to decrypt the following ciphertext, which was  encrypted using a Shift Cipher: 
         BMMTDXLTANZXXYYHKMMHYKXXRHNKLXEYYKHFFXFHKR 
      b. Use an exhaustive key search to decrypt the following ciphertext, which was encrypted  using a Multiplicative Cipher: 
         WFEJBYOFAJZEYDCMRBKJRKWABKXSWKJZSFQ 
      c. Use an exhaustive key search to decrypt the following ciphertext, which was encrypted  using a Affine Cipher: 
         EFXECFBDQGGXRADQTFFUFSPGAHQTDGGAFZDJFGHJFBDQGHGDCCGXSFJDHQGAFZDJF 
                                                                    
                                                                              ***********
