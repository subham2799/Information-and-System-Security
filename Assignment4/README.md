    Implement an Iterated Substitution Permutation cipher consisting of Nr = 4 rounds, with the following specifications:  
    1. Each round consists of round-key mixing followed by a substitution and a permutation.   
    2. 2. Assume the plain text and cipher text, each to be 8-bits long.  
    3. The key schedule is generated by selecting (4r-3)-th through (4r+4)-th key bits as the round key for round r. (The minimum length of the key is given by 1×8+ Nr×4=24 bits. Select a random string of 24 bits as the  key.)  
    4. The round key mixing is done by a bitwise XOR operation.  
    5. Perform key whitening at the beginning and end of each round.  
    6. Assuming l = 4, the substitution function at each round is specified by the following S-box:
        Input 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
        Output E 4 D 1 2 F B 8 3 A 6 C 5 9 0 7
    7. The permutation function for each round is:
        Input 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
        Output 1 4 5 7 3 6 2 8
    (Drop the permutation function at the last round. Think why.)  
    
    Implement both the encryption and decryption functions for the above cipher, in the following modes of  encipherment: 
    ∙ Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode
    ∙ Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode

    Enter the S-box:
    E4D12FB83A6C5907
    The S-box is: 
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
    E  4  D  1  2  F  B  8  3  A  6  C  5  9  0  7

    Enter the P-box:
    14573628
    The P-box is: 
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 
    1  4  5  7  3  6  2  8

    Enter the plaintext.
    10100100

    You entered: 10100100

    Final plaintext: 10100100

    The encrypted text is: 00110100
